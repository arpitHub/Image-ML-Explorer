# 🖼️ Image ML Explorer App

An interactive **Streamlit app** for learning how machine learning models process and classify image data.  
Students can explore datasets, preprocess images, build models, and visualize results — all with clear explanations and examples.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Dataset Explorer (📂)**  
  Preview image datasets (e.g., MNIST digits), inspect samples, and understand how images are stored as pixel arrays.

- **Preprocessing (🖼️)**  
  - Normalize pixel values (0–255 → 0–1).  
  - Flatten images into vectors or keep 2D structure.  
  - Teaching notes explaining why preprocessing matters.

- **Model Builder (🤖)**  
  - Train Logistic Regression and k‑Nearest Neighbors.  
  - Compare accuracy across models.  
  - Confusion matrix visualization.  
  - Teaching notes on strengths and limitations of each model.

- **Results (📊)**  
  - Test predictions on new images.  
  - Probability scores for confidence.  
  - Explore misclassified examples to understand model errors.

- **CNN Model (🧠)**  
  - Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
  - Visualize training vs validation accuracy.  
  - Compare CNN performance with classic ML models.

- **CNN Results (📊)**  
  - Test CNN predictions with probability scores.  
  - Explore misclassified examples to highlight CNN strengths and weaknesses.

- **Hand‑Drawn Image Tester (✍️)**
 - Draw your own digit directly in the app using an interactive canvas.
 - See how both classic ML models and CNNs interpret your sketch.
 - Learn why hand‑drawn inputs differ from curated datasets (noise, resolution mismatch, thicker strokes).
 - Reinforces the importance of preprocessing and robust models in real‑world scenarios.
